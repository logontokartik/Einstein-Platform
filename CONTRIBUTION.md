## Contribution

Great, you're looking for a way to contribute to this project.

There are a few things to obey:

1. Please open first an [issue](https://github.com/muenzpraeger/salesforce-einstein-platform-apex/issues) with your idea/request/bug. Be descriptive as possible.
2. Once it's agreed on what should be added how you can work on it (if you want). Any Apex change needs a test! We don't want to risk to get below the 75% mark. ;-)
3. After the work is done please submit a PR for review.


For JavaScript files a 4-space indentation (NO tab) is used. Please format before you submit a PR.
